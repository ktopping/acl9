h1. Introduction

This project was forked from "Smeevil/acl9":http://github.com/smeevil/acl9
The sole reason for this was in order for me to push it to "gemcutter":http://rubygems.org/gems/ktopping_acl9
You can, thus, use smeevil's "system role" functionality by simply including:
<pre><code>
  config.gem "ktopping_acl9", :source => "http://gemcutter.org", :lib => "acl9"
</code></pre>
in your config/environments.rb file.
The original project (and - thus - documentation) is "here":http://github.com/be9/acl9
